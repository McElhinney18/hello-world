This is my first step on the GitHub journey!
I'm learning how to create repositories, make branches, and commit changes.
In this readme‑edits branch, I’m practicing how to:

✏️ Edit files
🌱 Make and manage branches
💬 Write meaningful commit messages
🔄 Open pull requests

This is all part of getting comfortable with GitHub’s workflow and understanding how collaboration happens in real projects.
Thanks for checking out my first experiment with GitHub! 🚀
